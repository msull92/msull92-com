My name is Matthew Sullivan.
Currently, I'm a Site Reliability Engineer at [Star Tribune](http://www.startribune.com) in Minneapolis, MN.
Before that I was the Lead Web Engineer at [Botlink](https://botlink.com) and the CEO & co-founder of [Jumpr](https://jumpr.it).

I use this blog to write about technical topics like programming, machine learning, and data analysis.
